This document is the JavaDoc API for the Case Matcher Java library.
This library This library provides utility classes
that provide functionality to check for cases based on input objects/values and actions that
are executed based on this cases. This can be seen as a more enhanced version of Java's
switch-case statements. This core library ships with an eager version of matching cases
over an input object. To start matching on objects, it is recommended to have a look at the
static methods defined in {@link de.boereck.matcher.eager.EagerMatcher EagerMatcher}. When defining
match cases, the static functions defined in the helper classes of package {@link de.boereck.matcher.helpers}
can help to write more concise matching criteria or action code.
